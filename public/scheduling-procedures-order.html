    <div class="section">
      In order to administer the above-captioned civil case in a manner fair to the litigants and consistent with the parties' interest in completing this litigation in the shortest possible time and at the least possible cost,
    </div>
    <div class="section">it is this 31 day of October, 2006,</div>
    <div class="section">
      ORDERED that counsel for the plaintiff and the defendants are directed to comply with each of the following directives:
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>(1) COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE COURT:</h2>
      Counsel should endeavor to keep communications with chambers to a minimum. Counsel are advised that chambers staff cannot provide legal advice of any kind.
    </div>

    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <div class="page-header">Case 1:06-cv-01410-CKK Document 7 Filed 10/31/2006 Page 2 of 7</div>
    <div class="section">
      <em>Ex parte</em> communications on matters other than scheduling matters are prohibited. If counsel need to contact chambers, it should be done jointly pursuant to a telephone conference call arranged by the parties.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>(2) MOTIONS FOR EXTENSIONS OF TIME:</h2>
      Motions for extensions of time are strongly discouraged. Parties should not expect the court to grant extensions, as they will be granted only in truly exceptional or compelling circumstances. The parties are referred to <em>Jackson v. Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &amp; Dunner, et. al.</em>, 101 F.3d 145 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Motions for extension of time shall be filed at least four business days prior to the deadline the motion is seeking to extend. All motions for extensions must include the following (otherwise they will not be considered by the court):
    </div>
    <div class="indent">(a) how many, if any, previous extensions of time the court has granted to each party;</div>
    <div class="indent">(b) the specific grounds for the motion;</div>
    <div class="indent">(c) a statement of the effect that the court’s granting of the motion will have on all other previously set deadlines;</div>
    <div class="indent">(d) in cases where the motion seeks to extend the deadline for a dispositive motion, a suggested deadline for the filing of the opposition and reply; and</div>
    <div class="indent">(e) pursuant to Local Rule LCvR 7(m) (formerly LCvR 7.1(m)), the moving party shall include a statement of opposing counsel's position vis-a-vis the motion.</div>

    <div class="page-header">Case 1:06-cv-01410-CKK Document 7 Filed 10/31/2006 Page 3 of 7</div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>(3) PLEADINGS:</h2>
      (a) Every pleading shall indicate, immediately below the Civil Action No. in the caption, the next-scheduled Court deadline, such as a status conference, or pre-trial conference, or trial date.

    <div class="section">
      (b) Every pleading signed by an attorney or <em>pro se</em> party shall, in conformity with Local Rule LCvR 5.1(e), contain the name, address, telephone number, and for an attorney the bar identification number.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      (c) Counsel shall provide Chambers (NOT the Clerk’s Office), with a printed courtesy copy of any electronic submission that is over twenty-five (25) pages in total length, or that includes more than one exhibit and/or any exhibits more than ten (10) pages in length. Any exhibits shall be appropriately tabbed for ease of reference.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>(4) DISCOVERY DISPUTES:</h2>
      Counsel are referred to Local Rule LCvR 26.2 and expected to fully conform with its directives. Moreover, counsel are required, under both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f) and Local Rule LCvR 7.1(m), to confer in good faith in an effort to resolve any discovery dispute before bringing it to the court’s attention. If, in what should be the unusual case, counsel are unable to resolve their dispute, counsel shall contact chambers in order to arrange for a telephone conference with the court. Counsel shall not file a discovery motion without prior consultation with opposing counsel. Counsel are advised that if the court is called upon to resolve such a motion, the losing attorney (not the principal) will be sanctioned pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4).

      <h2>(5) DEPOSITION GUIDELINES:</h2>

    <div class="section">(e) If counsel for any party or person given notice of the deposition believes that these conditions are not being adhered to, that counsel may call for suspension of the deposition and then immediately apply to the court for a ruling and remedy. When appropriate, the court will impose sanctions;</div>
